// Controls the capturing & readback operation.
// 
// If no other operation has been activated, the controller samples data
// into the memory. When the run signal is received, it continues to do so
// for fwd * 4 samples and then sends bwd * 4 samples  to the transmitter.
// This allows to capture data from before the trigger match which is a nice 
// feature.
